              I worked at an outpatient pediatric clinic which offers multidisciplinary therapeutic services. I worked
              with individuals with varying diagnoses such as autism (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
              (ADHD), developmental delays, cerebral palsy (CP), and sensory processing disorder (SPD).

              I am familiar with administering and scoring the PDMS-3, BOT-2, DAYC-2, Sensory Profile, and PEDI. I also

            <li class="mb-2">
              I worked with kids in the sensory gym, at their homes (early intervention), and in schools. I utilized
              sensory integration techniques, listening programs, ADL (activities of daily living) interventions, and
              adaptive technology. Some sensory modalities I used daily include sensory motor courses, heavy work, and
              proprioceptive and vestibular integration.

            <li class="mb-2">
              My in-service consisted of creating a sensory board for the clients to utilize during treatment sessions
              to enhance fine motor skills, sensory processing, cognitive development, and emotional regulation. I
              completed research reviews on different sensory-based research articles for evidence-based sensory board
              tools/ techniques.

            <li class="mb-2">
              I completed a co-treatment with a physical therapist and collaborated with a speech therapist during
              feeding group sessions.
