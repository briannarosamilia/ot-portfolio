      This program has equipped me with the clinical skills and knowledge necessary to support clients in reaching their
      full potential through a holistic, evidence-based approach. I served as the Historian for the Student Occupational
      Therapy Association (SOTA), where I was responsible for maintaining and updating the school bulletin boards.
      Additionally, I collaborated with the community service committee to assist in planning and coordinating volunteer
      events that promoted community engagement.

      My degree in psychology has provided a strong foundation for entering the field of occupational therapy, where
      mental health plays a vital role in patient care. As OTs, we treat the whole person, addressing not only physical
      needs but also emotional and social factors that influence overall well-being.
